echo $TERM
The tput command can be used to test for a particular capability or to output the assigned value. Here are some examples:

tput longname

This outputs the full name of the current terminal type. We can specify another terminal type by including the -T option. Here, we will ask for the full name of the terminal type named "screen":

tput -T screen longname

We can inquire values from the terminfo database, like the number of supported colors and the number of columns in the current terminal:

tput colors
tput cols

We can test for particular capability. For example, to see if the current terminal supports "bce" (background color erase - meaning that clearing or erasing text will be done using the currently defined background color) we type:

tput bce && echo "True"

We can send instructions to the terminal. For example, to move the cursor to the position 20 characters to the right and 5 rows down:

tput cup 5 20

Reading Terminal Attributes

For the following capnames, tput outputs a value to stdout:
Capname 	Description
longname 	Full name of the terminal type
lines 	Number of lines in the terminal
cols 	Number of columns in the terminal
colors 	Number of colors available

Controlling The Cursor

The capnames below output strings containing control codes that instruct the terminal to manipulate the cursor:
Capname 	Description
sc 	Save the cursor position
rc 	Restore the cursor position
home 	Move the cursor to upper left corner (0,0)
cup <row> <col> 	Move the cursor to position row, col
cud1 	Move the cursor down 1 line
cuu1 	Move the cursor up 1 line
civis 	Set to cursor to be invisible
cnorm 	Set the cursor to its normal state

Text Effects

Like the capnames used for cursor manipulation, the following capnames output strings of control codes that affect the way our terminal displays text characters:
Capname 	Description
bold 	Start bold text
smul 	Start underlined text
rmul 	End underlined text
rev 	Start reverse video
blink 	Start blinking text
invis 	Start invisible text
smso 	Start "standout" mode
rmso 	End "standout" mode
sgr0 	Turn off all attributes
setaf <value> 	Set foreground color
setab <value> 	Set background color

Text Color

Most terminals support 8 foreground text colors and 8 background colors (though some support as many as 256). Using the setaf and setab capabilities, we can set the foreground and background colors. The exact rendering of colors is a little hard to predict. Many desktop managers impose "system colors" on terminal windows, thereby modifying foreground and background colors from the standard. Despite this, here are what the colors should be:
Value 	Color
0 	Black
1 	Red
2 	Green
3 	Yellow
4 	Blue
5 	Magenta
6 	Cyan
7 	White
8 	Not used
9 	Reset to default color

Clearing The Screen

These capnames allow us to selectively clear portions of the terminal display:
Capname 	Description
smcup 	Save screen contents
rmcup 	Restore screen contents
el 	Clear from the cursor to the end of the line
el1 	Clear from the cursor to the beginning of the line
ed 	Clear from the cursor to the end of the screen
clear 	Clear the entire screen and home the cursor
